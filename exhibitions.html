        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <p>
          Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky
          Above Us’, 
          <br/> explores the night sky and what we can see and know about
          the universe around us. 
          <br />We’ll locate the various constellationsand
          galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about 
          <br />the early navigators
          who used the stars to travel by.
          <br />
          Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders,
          to Galileo’s telescope, 
          <br />to the latestexploration of the planets in our
          solar system

        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
          question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here?
          <br />
          Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had aframework
          for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
          <br />
          Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
          know today have evolved our time.
          <br />You can also take some time to meet a
          few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our WoollyMammoth,
          the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

        <h2>Biology & Medicine</h2>
        <p>
          From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology
          are offering us uniqueinsights into the great wonders of the tiny
          world.
          <br />
          For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality
          of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
          medicine. 
          <br />
          Over a series of exhibits we explore the history ofmedicine
          and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
          penicillin and the firstheart transplant.
          <br />
          Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the
          lab, but also from observinganimals in the wild. Often our fellow
          creatures have beat us to it.

        <h2>Robotics & AI</h2>
        <p>
          The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
          intelligence are the science of the future.
          <br />From useful home
          applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.
          <br />You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

        <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <p>
          As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
          planet, the more important it becomes
          <br /> that scientists explore how to
          create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
          planet.
          <br />
          In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
          currently face 
          <br />including globalwarming, extinction of species, and
          pollution. 
          <br />But we also focus on the positive ways we can allcontribute
          to a brighter future.

              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
              exhibition is coming to theCommunity Science Museum. It’s a series
              of installations that allow visitors to experience the power ofthe
              elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting,
              to ‘Wind Island’ that shows howturbines are able to use and
              control wind to create power.
